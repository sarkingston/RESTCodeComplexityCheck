# Chatserver

This chatserver is for module CS4400 taught by Stephen Barrett. 

The crazy number of commits is due to the fact the test server was sitting on a server in the colleges SCSS network and my server must be on the network to test. I was doing the programming in college on a different machine and then copied it onto my own for commits to occur.
